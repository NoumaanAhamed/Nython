# Nython

Not Only Python. Python with Curly Braces instead of indentation, Basically Javascript lol

Nython is a Python preprocessor which translates curly brackets into indentation.

## Setup

Nython works by translating Nython files  into Python files, and then using Python to run them.

To run a Nython program, simply type

```
$ python script.py <input-file>.ny -o <output-file>.py && python <output-file>.py
```
